# Acknowledgments

## Scientific Foundation
We gratefully acknowledge the authors of the original MATLAB implementation and protocol:
- Ashley L. Juavinett
- Ian Nauhaus
- Marina E. Garrett
- Jun Zhuang
- Edward M. Callaway

Their foundational work in "Automated identification of mouse visual areas with intrinsic signal imaging" (Nature Protocols, 2016) made this Python implementation possible.

## Research Support
This project was developed in the Kim Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz, which investigates the organizational logic of long-distance cortical circuits and molecular mechanisms of their development.

### Institutional Support
